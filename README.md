# WPF_GameWorld
A WPF application created for a programming test that creates actors which can be player controlled or move to random points.

-Actors can be toggled between user and auto movement.

-Controls are WASD for movement, Numpad 1 2 3 adjust movement speed of player actors, Numpad 4 5 6 adjust rotation speed of player actors, Numpad 0 to reset both move and rotation speeds, up and down arrows change the selected actor and space changes the control tupe of the selected actor.

-Actors that are not player controlled move to a random point, first on the x axis then on the y axis.

-The colours of the actors are: 
	-HotPink  			Highlighted.
	-LightSeaGreen  	Not player controlled.
	-CornflowerBlue  	Player controlled.
